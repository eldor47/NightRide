Unity based 3D multiplayer server and client

This project utilizes C# to create a multiplayer client server model from ground up using Unity. The server utilizes TCP and UDP
connections to allow multiple players to be connected to a server and walk around / jump in 3D space. There is also a global chat
system as well as dynamically moving platforms.

To run this, import the projects into Unity, start the server first, then open another instance of Unity and start the client
